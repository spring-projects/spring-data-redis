= Spring Data Redis image:https://jenkins.spring.io/buildStatus/icon?job=spring-data-redis%2Fmain&subject=Build[link=https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-redis/] https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[image:https://badges.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data.svg[Gitter]] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/Revved%20up%20by-Gradle%20Enterprise-06A0CE?logo=Gradle&labelColor=02303A["Revved up by Gradle Enterprise", link="https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.rootProjectNames=Spring Data Redis"]

The primary goal of the https://spring.io/projects/spring-data/[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

This modules provides integration with the https://redis.io/[Redis] store.

== Features

* Connection package as low-level abstraction across multiple Redis drivers (https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core[Lettuce] and https://github.com/redis/jedis[Jedis]).
* Exception translation to Spring’s portable Data Access exception hierarchy for Redis driver exceptions
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-redis/docs/current/reference/html/#redis:template[`RedisTemplate`] that provides a high level abstraction for performing various Redis operations, exception translation and serialization support.
* Pubsub support (such as a MessageListenerContainer for message-driven POJOs).
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-redis/docs/current/reference/html/#redis:sentinel[Redis Sentinel] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-redis/docs/current/reference/html/#cluster[Redis Cluster] support.
* Reactive API using the Lettuce driver.
* JDK, String, JSON and Spring Object/XML mapping serializers.
* JDK Collection implementations on top of Redis.
* Atomic counter support classes.
* Sorting and Pipelining functionality.
* Dedicated support for SORT, SORT/GET pattern and returned bulk values.
* Redis implementation for Spring 3.1 cache abstraction.
* Automatic implementation of `Repository` interfaces including support for custom finder methods using `@EnableRedisRepositories`.
* CDI support for repositories.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/e3cc2ff230d8f1dca06535aa6b5a4a23815861d4/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Redis in Java:

[source,java]
----
public class Example {

    // inject the actual template
    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, String> template;

    // inject the template as ListOperations
    // can also inject as Value, Set, ZSet, and HashOperations
    @Resource(name="redisTemplate")
    private ListOperations<String, String> listOps;

    public void addLink(String userId, URL url) {
        listOps.leftPush(userId, url.toExternalForm());
        // or use template directly
        redisTemplate.boundListOps(userId).leftPush(url.toExternalForm());
    }
}

@Configuration
class ApplicationConfig {

  @Bean
  public RedisConnectionFactory redisConnectionFactory() {
    return new LettuceConnectionFactory();
  }
}
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-redis</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-redis</artifactId>
  <version>${version}-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
</repository>

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/docs/reference/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki#release-notes[Release notes] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data[`spring-data-redis`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data Redis at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/issues/new[github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses Github as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests.
If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue does not already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using, the JVM version, Stacktrace, etc.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[Markdown] code fences +++```+++.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 17 or above.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.8.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pantora
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/antora/site/index.html`.

== Guides

The https://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring Data step-by-step:

* https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-redis/[Messaging with Redis]: Learn how to use Redis as a message broker.
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-data-reactive-redis/[Accessing Data Reactively with Redis]: Learn how to reactively interface with Redis and Spring Data.

== Examples

* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/[Spring Data Examples] contains example projects that explain specific features in more detail.
