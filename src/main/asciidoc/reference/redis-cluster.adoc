== Enabling Redis Cluster

Cluster support is based on the same building blocks as non-clustered communication. `RedisClusterConnection`, an extension to `RedisConnection`, handles the communication with the Redis Cluster and translates errors into the Spring DAO exception hierarchy.
`RedisClusterConnection` instances are created with the `RedisConnectionFactory`, which has to be set up with the associated `RedisClusterConfiguration`, as shown in the following example:

.Sample RedisConnectionFactory Configuration for Redis Cluster
====
[source,java]
----
@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.redis.cluster")
public class ClusterConfigurationProperties {

    /*
     * spring.redis.cluster.nodes[0] = 127.0.0.1:7379
     * spring.redis.cluster.nodes[1] = 127.0.0.1:7380
     * ...
     */
    List<String> nodes;

    /**
     * Get initial collection of known cluster nodes in format {@code host:port}.
     *
     * @return
     */
    public List<String> getNodes() {
        return nodes;
    }

    public void setNodes(List<String> nodes) {
        this.nodes = nodes;
    }
}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    /**
     * Type safe representation of application.properties
     */
    @Autowired ClusterConfigurationProperties clusterProperties;

    public @Bean RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {

        return new LettuceConnectionFactory(
            new RedisClusterConfiguration(clusterProperties.getNodes()));
    }
}

[TIP]
====
`RedisClusterConfiguration` can also be defined through `PropertySource` and has the following properties:

.Configuration Properties
- `spring.redis.cluster.nodes`: Comma-delimited list of host:port pairs.
- `spring.redis.cluster.max-redirects`: Number of allowed cluster redirections.
====

NOTE: The initial configuration points driver libraries to an initial set of cluster nodes. Changes resulting from live cluster reconfiguration are kept only in the native driver and are not written back to the configuration.

[[cluster.working.with.cluster]]
== Working With Redis Cluster Connection

As mentioned earlier, Redis Cluster behaves differently from single-node Redis or even a Sentinel-monitored master-replica environment. This is because the automatic sharding maps a key to one of 16384 slots, which are distributed across the nodes. Therefore, commands that involve more than one key must assert all keys map to the exact same slot to avoid cross-slot errors.
A single cluster node serves only a dedicated set of keys. Commands issued against one particular server return results only for those keys served by that server. As a simple example, consider the `KEYS` command. When issued to a server in a cluster environment, it returns only the keys served by the node the request is sent to and not necessarily all keys within the cluster. So, to get all keys in a cluster environment, you must read the keys from all the known master nodes.

While redirects for specific keys to the corresponding slot-serving node are handled by the driver libraries, higher-level functions, such as collecting information across nodes or sending commands to all nodes in the cluster, are covered by `RedisClusterConnection`. Picking up the keys example from earlier, this means that the `keys(pattern)` method picks up every master node in the cluster and simultaneously runs the `KEYS` command on every master node while picking up the results and returning the cumulated set of keys. To just request the keys of a single node `RedisClusterConnection` provides overloads for those methods (for example, `keys(node, pattern)`).

A `RedisClusterNode` can be obtained from `RedisClusterConnection.clusterGetNodes` or it can be constructed by using either the host and the port or the node Id.

The following example shows a set of commands being run across the cluster:

====

When all keys map to the same slot, the native driver library automatically serves cross-slot requests, such as `MGET`. However, once this is not the case, `RedisClusterConnection` runs multiple parallel `GET` commands against the slot-serving nodes and again returns an accumulated result. This is less performant than the single-slot approach and, therefore, should be used with care. If in doubt, consider pinning keys to the same slot by providing a prefix in curly brackets, such as `{my-prefix}.thing1` and `{my-prefix}.thing2`, which will both map to the same slot number. The following example shows cross-slot request handling:

TIP: The preceding examples demonstrate the general strategy followed by Spring Data Redis. Be aware that some operations might require loading huge amounts of data into memory to compute the desired command. Additionally, not all cross-slot requests can safely be ported to multiple single slot requests and error if misused (for example, `PFCOUNT`).

[[cluster.redistemplate]]
== Working with `RedisTemplate` and `ClusterOperations`

See the <<redis:template>> section for information about the general purpose, configuration, and usage of `RedisTemplate`.

CAUTION: Be careful when setting up `RedisTemplate#keySerializer` using any of the JSON `RedisSerializers`, as changing JSON structure has immediate influence on hash slot calculation.

`RedisTemplate` provides access to cluster-specific operations through the `ClusterOperations` interface, which can be obtained from `RedisTemplate.opsForCluster()`. This lets you explicitly run commands on a single node within the cluster while retaining the serialization and deserialization features configured for the template. It also provides administrative commands (such as `CLUSTER MEET`) or more high-level operations (for example, resharding).

The following example shows how to access `RedisClusterConnection` with `RedisTemplate`:
