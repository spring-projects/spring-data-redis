    <title>Why Spring Data Redis?</title>

    <para>The Spring Framework is the leading full-stack Java/JEE
    application framework. It provides a lightweight container and a
    non-invasive programming model enabled by the use of dependency
    injection, AOP, and portable service abstractions.</para>

    storages provide an alternative to classical RDBMS for horizontal scalability
    and speed. In terms of implementation, Key Value stores represent one of the
    largest (and oldest) members in the NoSQL space.</para>

    <para>The Spring Data Redis (or SDR) framework makes it easy to 
    write Spring applications that use the Redis key value store by eliminating the redundant
    tasks and boiler plate code required for interacting with the store through
    Spring's excellent infrastructure support.</para>
